Quickstart
==========

The fastest way you can get started is by using the plot module

there are two versions of $project:

- python 2.7
- python 3.x

they are located under:

- src/grafikrechner/python27
- src/grafikrechner/python30

as per your use case copy either verion to your project directory, the syntax is the same

First Program
-------------

to get started import the the plot module,
since the plot module is in another directory firstly add the directory to your python path::

    
    import sys
    sys.path.append("..\\grafikrechner\\python27")
    

now you can import the plot.py module::

    
    from plot import *
