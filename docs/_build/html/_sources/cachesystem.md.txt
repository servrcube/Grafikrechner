## What is cacheSys

### Overview

CacheSys is a module to save variables to a file, so that they can be read by another program.
all files are saved in a pickle format and indexed in a cacheStore.json file in the cache folder.

### What problems does this solve

Normally if you were to store a variable to a file directly,it would only store a pointer to the variable, 
by pickling the variable you are able to store the individual values.

## How to use cacheSys

Remember to include the folder in your sys.path, [how to?](quickstart.html#include-modules)

```python
from cacheSys import *

#use a directory for storing your variables
cachePath "./path/to/your/cache/"
#pick a extension (all files are stored in pickle format)
extention = "example"

#init the cache class
cache = cache(cachePath, extention)

yourVar = "your Value"

#inststance name to store and access your variable
instanceName = "exampleVar"

#Note: you can store the same variable under diffrent instance names
#but storing to the same instance name will overrite the instance

#to store a variable
cache.writeVar(yourVar,instance)

#to read a variable
valueOfCachedVar = cache.readVar(instance)

#to delete a variable
cache.removeVar(instance)
```

your cached variables will indexed in a JSON file called jsonStore.json like this:

``` json
{
    "exampleVar": "./path/to/your/cache/exampleVar.example"
}
```
